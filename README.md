## Project Overview üöÄ

This project focuses on analysing sales data from a retail company. The goal was to process the dataset, calculate commissions and gain insights into total sales, individual performance and trends using Excel.

Key highlights of the project:
- **Sales Commission**: Created a column to calculate commission based on the sales amount.
- **Total Sales**: Added a column to calculate the total sales per transaction.
- **Data Summarisation**: Used pivot tables and charts to summarise and visualise the data.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Excel**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation.

## Data Analysis Techniques üîç

I applied a variety of Excel functions to analyse the data:

- **SUM**: Calculated the total sales and commissions.
- **AVERAGE**: Calculated the average sales per transaction.
- **UNIQUE**: Identified unique values, such as different products or employees.
- **VLOOKUP**: Retrieved related information based on a lookup value.
- **SUMIF & SUMIFS**: Summed data based on one or more criteria.
- **Cell Referencing**: Used absolute and relative references for dynamic calculations.
- **Pivot Tables**: Organised and summarised data to analyse sales by product, region, or employee.
- **Pivot Charts**: Visualised the summarised data to identify trends.
- **Slicers**: Added slicers to filter pivot tables and charts interactively.

## Conclusion üéØ

This analysis provides insights into the performance of sales employees, popular products and overall sales trends. The combination of Excel functions and visualisation tools helped to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.
